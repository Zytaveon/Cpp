Hello there little dewey. How are you doing today? This is just some practice
text to use for the wordSorter thingy. Hopefully there is a few words that overlap
so that it can actually be counted. WHo knows.
Will probably also need to deal with the strings and pull them all to lowercase
or uppdercase. It really doesnt matter. Also will need to get some of the punctuation dealt with because harsh and harsh. wont be
the same word since one has a period. We will figure it out hopefully.
just need to motivation to do something. And going to have to get the console fixed or terminal whatever word you want to use. I literally
cant use shift and j at the same time because it will open the terminal at any second no matter what mode i am in. So need to change the bind
to control and j or change so it only opens it in normal mode. Will have to figure it out.
